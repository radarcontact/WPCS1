NOTES:


This is used for Whirlpool washers that are coin slide. The dryers require a power spark. They do not have a circuit board. This code is identical to the ALCSx code. The only difference is the pulse duration is 100ms instead of 25ms. When I tested with 25ms it didn't wok. It's likely the ALCSx will work with 100ms pulse duration. We should likely combine them into one SKU.
